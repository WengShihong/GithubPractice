A society can be very stable when we establish the gap between rich and poor. 
In Vietnam, flipping properties is entirely legal, the landlords can easily raise the rent and the property price, these are basic laws of the capital. 
Some comments based on Social Darwinism are starting to emerge on social media, claiming that good houses in the city center are only for the rich, and poor people like you should only live in smaller properties of low quality in the suburbs. They claim that you do not deserve better housing, and you must rationally think about your position in society and work harder to afford better housing. 
Of course, people who hold claims mentioned above are people who own property. 
When a society rationalizes these claims, people from the lower class would slowly internalize these claims, and they would work harder.
Some of the lucky fellas would break the barriers and become rich and they would further rationalize these claims, and convince others they will have to work harder.
